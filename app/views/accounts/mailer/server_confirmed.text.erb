Hi <%= @user.greeting %>,

Your order of server <%= @server.to_s %> on account <%= @account.to_s %> has been confirmed.

Our server robots are hard at work preparing your server and will email you once it's ready for your use. If there are any problems getting your server up and running, someone from support will be paged to fix it up.

Here's some information about the server being built:

Hostname: <%= @server.hostname %>
Location: <%= @server.cluster_name %>
Plan: <%= @server.plan_name %>
Price: <%= @server.render_amount_plaintext %>/mo
Operating System: <%= @server.template_name %>

You can view this server at <%= polymorphic_url [:users, @server.account, :solus, @server] %>

Thanks,
James, Taylor, and Kevin at vNucleus
