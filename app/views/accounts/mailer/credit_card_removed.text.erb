Hi <%= @user.greeting %>,

The credit card on file for account <%= @account.to_s %> has been automatically removed. This can happen when the card has expired, or if your account has had no service for a short period of time.

You can update your billing information at <%= polymorphic_url [:edit, :users, @account, :credit_cards] %>

Thanks,
James, Taylor, and Kevin at vNucleus
