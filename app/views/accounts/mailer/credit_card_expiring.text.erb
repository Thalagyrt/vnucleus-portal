Hi <%= @user.greeting %>,

The credit card on file for account <%= @account.to_s %> expires on <%= @account.render_stripe_expiration_date %>. We want to make sure your servers stay online, so please update your information when you have a chance!

You can update your billing information at <%= polymorphic_url [:edit, :users, @account, :credit_cards] %>

Thanks,
