vNucleus Portal

### THIS IS NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED

This is an in-house billing suite/CRM/ticketing system/the works written
by me, [James Riley](https://github.com/Thalagyrt), for the now-defunct
web hosting company I used to run, vNucleus.

This repo has been sanitized and certain proprietary assets removed.
_THIS CODE WILL NOT RUN IN ITS CURRENT STATE DUE TO THIS REMOVAL._

This has been open sourced mostly to have a repo out in the wild that
demonstrates my programming style, but also so others can read and learn
from it - good decisions and mistakes alike.
