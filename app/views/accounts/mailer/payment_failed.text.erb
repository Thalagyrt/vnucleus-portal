Hi <%= @user.greeting %>,

We want to make sure your service stays online, however our recent attempt to charge <%= @amount %> to the on-file credit card on account <%= @account.to_s %> has failed.

You can view and update your billing information at <%= polymorphic_url [:users, @account, :credit_cards] %>

Please be aware that your service will be suspended at 7 days past-due and terminated at 21 days past-due.

Thanks,
James, Taylor, and Kevin at vNucleus
